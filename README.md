# üöó Autonomous Vehicle Navigation System

## Overview
A sophisticated self-driving car implementation using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This project combines real-time object detection, stop sign recognition, and motor control to create an autonomous navigation system.

## üåü Key Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLO v4 Tiny
- Stop sign recognition and automated response
- Webcam-based visual input processing
- Motor control system for vehicle navigation
- Data collection and training pipeline
- TensorFlow Lite optimization for improved performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture
The project is structured into several key modules:
- **DataCollectionModule.py**: Handles data logging and collection
- **WebcamModule.py**: Manages real-time video input
- **MotorModule.py**: Controls vehicle movement and steering
- **KeyboardModule.py**: Provides manual control interface
- **object_detect.py**: Implements object detection using YOLO
- **stop.py**: Dedicated stop sign detection system
- **Training.py**: ML model training pipeline
